##  Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals - Core Infrastructure: Getting Started with Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL

## Objectives:
 In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
  1.Create a Cloud Storage bucket and place an image into it.
  2.Create a Cloud SQL instance and configure it.
  3.Connect to the Cloud SQL instance from a web server.
  4.Use the image in the Cloud Storage bucket on a web page.

    
 -Deploy a webserver:
  1. creare a VM named bloghost and allow http traffic, and enter a startup script.
   ~ gcloud compute instances create bloghost --zone=us-central1-a --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --image-project=debian-cloud --image=debian-9-stretch-v20200910 --metadata=^,@^startup-script=apt-get\ update,apt-get\ install\ apache2\ php\ php-mysql\ -y,service\ apache2\ restart --tags=http-server
   ~ gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:80 --target-tags=http-server --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0
  2. view and copy the internal and external IP addresses to a text editor to use later.
   ~ gcloud compute instances list
  3. copy the public IP of the vm for use later in the lab
 
 
 -Create a cloud storage bucket:
  1. enter your chosen location into an environment variable called LOCATION
   ~ export LOCATION=US

  2.  Enter this command to make a bucket named after your project ID, the DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID environment variable contains your project ID:
   ~ gsutil mb -l $LOCATION gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
   
  3. Retrieve a banner image from a publicly accessible Cloud Storage location:
   ~ gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gcpfci/my-excellent-blog.png my-excellent-blog.png
  
  4. Copy the banner image to your newly created Cloud Storage bucket:
   ~ gsutil cp my-excellent-blog.png gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/my-excellent-blog.png

  5. Modify the Access Control List of the object you just created so that it is readable by everyone:
   ~ gsutil acl ch -u allUsers:R gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/my-excellent-blog.png
   
 -Create a cloud SQL instance:
  1. create the blog-db instance
   ~ gcloud sql instances create blog-db --root-password=123456 --zone=us-central1-a --assign-ip --database-version=MYSQL_5_7
  
  2 copy the Public IP address for your SQL instance to a text editor for use later in this lab.
   ~ gcloud sql instances list   
   
  2. Create a user for the DB
   ~ gcloud sql users create blogdbuser --instance=blog-db --password=123456 

  3. Authorize the external IP address for the bloghost VM here [ENTER THE PUBLIC IP OF blog-db VM/32] below e.g 35.192.208.5/32
   ~ gcloud compute instances list 
   ~ gcloud sql instances patch blog-db --authorized-networks=[ENTER THE PUBLIC IP OF blog-db VM/32] 
      
  

 -Configure an application in a Compute Engine instance to use Cloud SQL
 
  1. connect to bloghost vm using ssh
   ~ gcloud compute ssh bloghost
   
  2. In your ssh session on bloghost, change your working directory to the document root of the web server:
   ~ cd /var/www/html
  
  3. Use the nano text editor to edit a file called index.php:
   ~ sudo nano index.php

  4. Paste the content below into the file:
   ~ <html>
     <head><title>Welcome to my excellent blog</title></head>
     <body>
     <h1>Welcome to my excellent blog</h1>
     <?php
     $dbserver = "CLOUDSQLIP";
     $dbuser = "blogdbuser";
     $dbpassword = "DBPASSWORD";
     // In a production blog, we would not store the MySQL
     // password in the document root. Instead, we would store it in a
     // configuration file elsewhere on the web server VM instance.

     $conn = new mysqli($dbserver, $dbuser, $dbpassword);

     if (mysqli_connect_error()) {
             echo ("Database connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
     } else {
             echo ("Database connection succeeded.");
     }
     ?>
     </body></html>
  
  5. Press Ctrl+O, and then press Enter to save your edited file.

  6. Press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.

  7. Restart the web server:
   ~ sudo service apache2 restart

  8. Open a new web browser tab and paste into the address bar your bloghost VM instance's external IP address followed by /index.php. e.g 35.192.208.5/index.php, When you load the page, you will see that its content includes an error message

  9. Return to your ssh session on bloghost. Use the nano text editor to edit index.php again.
   ~ sudo nano index.php
  
  10. In the nano text editor, replace CLOUDSQLIP with the Cloud SQL instance Public IP address that you noted above

  11. In the nano text editor, replace DBPASSWORD  with the Cloud SQL database password that you noted above

  12. Press Ctrl+O, and then press Enter to save your edited file.

  13. Press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.

  14. Restart the web server:
   ~ sudo service apache2 restart
  
  15. Return to the web browser tab in which you opened your bloghost VM instance's external IP address,load the page and you will see that its content includes a message of connection succeeded.

 -Configure an application in a Compute Engine instance to use a Cloud Storage object
 
  1. copy the public link url for the object in the bucket, replace "bucket name" with your bucket name in the lab and "object name" with the object name in the lab(my-excellent-blog.png)
  ~ gsutil ls -L gs://bucket/obj1

  1. Return to the ssh session on the bloghost VM
   ~ gcloud compute ssh bloghost

  2. set your working directory to the document root of the web server:
   ~ cd /var/www/html

  3. Use the nano text editor to edit index.php:
   ~ sudo nano index.php
  
  4. Paste this HTML markup immediately before the URL:
   ~<img src='

  5. Place a closing single quotation mark and a closing angle bracket at the end of the URL:
   ~ '>
   result looks like this: <img src='https://storage.googleapis.com/qwiklabs-gcp-0005e186fa559a09/my-excellent-blog.png'>

  6. Press Ctrl+O, and then press Enter to save your edited file.

  7. Press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.
 
  8. Restart the web server:
   ~ sudo service apache2 restart

  9. Return to the web browser tab in which you opened your bloghost VM instance's external IP address. When you load the page, its content now includes a banner image.
